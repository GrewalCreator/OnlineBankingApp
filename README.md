Recovered Old Java Swing Banking Application Making Use Of OOP In A GUI Focused Program

My plan to recreate an updated version of this program, implementing all the new skills i've learned since this highschool project.
The new design will either use a Web-Development approach to use html, css and JS to create the front-end & perhaps PHP to work with databases on the back-end.
Thus making this a Full-Stack project
